# Singapore Resale Flat Prices Prediction

## Project Overview
This project develops a machine learning model to predict the resale prices of flats in Singapore, utilizing a user-friendly web application. This tool assists potential buyers and sellers by providing estimated resale values based on historical transaction data.

## Motivation
In the competitive and complex market of Singapore's resale flats, accurate price prediction can significantly help buyers and sellers make informed decisions. This project addresses this need by implementing predictive analytics.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning to ensure quality inputs.
- Advanced feature engineering for improving model accuracy.
- Utilizing robust regression models for price prediction.
- A Streamlit web application for easy user interaction.
- Deployment on the Render platform for global accessibility.

## Built With
- **Python** - Primary programming language.
- **Pandas** - For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn** - For implementing machine learning algorithms.
- **Streamlit** - For creating the web application.
- **Render** - For deploying the application on the cloud.

## Dataset
The dataset comprises resale flat transactions recorded by the Singapore Housing and Development Board (HDB) from 1990 to the present. It can be accessed through [this link](https://beta.data.gov.sg/collections/189/datasets/d_8b84c4ee58e3cfc0ece0d773c8ca6abc/view).
